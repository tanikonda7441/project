# Machine Learning to Improve Employee Productivity

## Project Overview
This project leverages **machine learning algorithms** to evaluate and improve employee productivity within organizations. By analyzing employee activity data, the system assigns **productivity scores** and identifies patterns that impact organizational efficiency. The application is developed in **Python** using **Google Colab**, making it accessible on any system with an internet connection.

## Motivation
Employee performance directly impacts operational productivity and long-term business objectives. Organizations face challenges in monitoring and comparing employee efficiency, especially across diverse tasks. This project aims to **automate productivity analysis**, provide actionable insights, and support data-driven decision-making.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze employee rating datasets and preprocess the data to remove noisy or null values.  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns in employee performance.  
- Implement machine learning models to predict productivity scores and evaluate performance.  
- Develop a scalable system to continuously monitor and compare employee productivity.  
- Visualize results to guide management decisions and improve overall workforce efficiency.

---

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Oversaw cleaning, normalization, and preparation of employee datasets.  
- **Machine Learning Modeling:** Implemented **Random Forest Classifier (RFC)** for productivity prediction.  
- **Analysis & Reporting:** Generated classification reports and visualizations to interpret model results.  
- **Collaboration:** Worked with team members to select suitable algorithms and validate model performance.

## Methodology
1. **Dataset Collection:** Gathered employee rating data.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Removed null values and handled noisy data.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigated trends, distributions, and feature correlations.  
4. **Machine Learning Modeling:** Applied RFC and other ML algorithms to predict productivity.  
5. **Evaluation:** Measured model performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score**.  
6. **Reporting:** Visualized results for actionable insights.

## How to Run
1. Open the project notebook in **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**.  
2. Upload the dataset (employee ratings).  
3. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and visualize results.  
4. Analyze the productivity scores and classification reports generated.
